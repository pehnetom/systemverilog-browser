# SystemVerilog Browser package

This package, helps to track long systemverilog classes. Current Features:
* Finds all class definitions in current file
* Finds all tasks/functions
* Jumping to class,task and function definition by clicking on the name of the element in Systemverilog browser window
* Hotkeys for toggle on/off are `ctrl` + `alt` + `s`

There are lot of bugs, no test implemented yet.

TO-DO:
* Better searching for systemverilog elements
* Searching for other sytemverilog elements
* Better cascading of the systemverilog elements
* Search for other files in systemverilog hierarchy
